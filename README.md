# Rust

#### Installation
We need to install two things:

1) The rust language https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

2) C++ Build tools https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019
    - The one you are looking for is: "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019"
    - one that is downloaded check the 'C++ build tools' and download that


Now check to make sure that rust was installed. Type the following in the cmd: 
```shell
rustc --version
```
