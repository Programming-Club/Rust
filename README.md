# Rust

### Installation
We need to install two things:

1) The rust language https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

2) C++ Build tools https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019
    - The one you are looking for is: "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019"
    - one that is downloaded check the 'C++ build tools' and download that


Now check to make sure that rust was installed. Type the following in the cmd: 
```shell
rustc --version
```
If you got something similar to this then your all good :)
```shell 
rustc 1.41.0 (5e1a79984 2020-01-27)
```


### Resources
There are two resources that we will use. 'The Rust Book' goes into detail about how the rust language is implemented and 'Rust by Example' is more of a code-along styled book. I recommend using both since they both have their ups and downs.
- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
